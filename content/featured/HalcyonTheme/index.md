<!-- [Log map ontology matching system](https://github.com/ernestojimenezruiz/logmap-matcher) to find the mapping between different classes and properties in the Knowledge bases, which was then integrated with other subgroups using [DEER framework](https://en.cs.uni-paderborn.de/de/ds/news-single/deer-rdf-data-extraction-and-enrichment-framework), an RDF data extraction and enrichment framework, to fuse multiple knowledge graphs(KGs) into different KGs with common data. -->
Redesigned [JoBooking](https://jobooking.de/)'s dashboard to elevate user experiences, integrated seamless swiper playlists and booking functionalities for intuitive navigation, and upheld clean coding practices in a structured, Agile (Kanban) development process.
