Password Vault is a secure web application that allows users to store, manage, and view sensitive credentials—like logins, cards, notes, and personal info—all in one place. It features dynamic, category-based forms and encrypts every piece of sensitive data, including metadata. Each credential is strictly user-specific and securely organized by category for both safety and ease of access.
