As a volunteer web developer at [GadgetLend](https://comfort-ar.de/services.html), I leverage my expertise to refine the application's CSS, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent user interface. I design and implement engaging marketing banners that captivate the target audience, contributing to the app's promotional strategy. Additionally, I develop an intuitive feedback form, streamlining user communication and facilitating the collection of valuable insights to drive continuous improvement.
